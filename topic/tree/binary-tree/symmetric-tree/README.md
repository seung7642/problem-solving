# Symmetric Tree

## 🚀 Problem  
Given the `root` of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

## 📝 Examples  

### Example 1

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```

## ⚡ Constraints  
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 1000]`
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
