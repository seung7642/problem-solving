# Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II

## 🚀 Problem  
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its node's values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

## 📝 Examples  

### Example 1
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[15,7],[9,20],[3]]
```

### Example 2
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

### Example 3
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

## ⚡ Constraints  
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
